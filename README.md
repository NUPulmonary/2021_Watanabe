# Resetting proteostasis with ISRIB promotes epithelial differentiation to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis

Pulmonary fibrosis is a relentlessly progressive and often fatal disease with a paucity of available therapies. 
Genetic evidence implicates disordered epithelial repair, which is normally achieved by the differentiation 
of small cuboidal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells into large, flattened alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells as 
an initiating event in pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. Using models of pulmonary fibrosis in young adult 
and old mice and a model of adult alveolo- genesis after pneumonectomy, we show that administration of ISRIB, 
a small molecule that restores protein translation by EIF2B during activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR), accelerated the differentiation of AT2 into AT1 cells. Accelerated epithelial repair reduced 
the recruitment of profibrotic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages and ameliorated lung fibrosis. These 
findings suggest a dysfunctional role for the ISR in regeneration of the alveolar epithelium after injury 
with implications for therapy.
